^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/sorting/sortby-response*
^|Test Purpose |Validate the availability of the `+sortby+` query parameter.
^|Requirement |<<req_sorting_sortby-response,/req/sorting/sortby-response>>
^|Test Method |. Construct a path for a collection page.
. Issue an HTTP GET request on the path.
. Check that the `+defaultSortOrder+` attribute exists.
. Construct a path for collection sortables.
. Issue an HTTP GET request on the path
. For each sortable found in the `+defaultSortOrder+` array, check that it is present in the results of the sortables result.
^|Test Method |. Construct a path for a collection page.
. Issue an HTTP GET request on the path.
. Check that the `+defaultSortOrder+` attribute exists.
. Using one sortable, construct a path for an `+.../items+` query with `+sortby+` using explicit ascending order (`+`).
. Issue an HTTP GET request on the path.
. Parse the response to capture the sortable property for each record returned.
. Verify that sorting the list of sortable properties in ascending order is consistent with the response of the server.
. Using one sortable, construct a path for an `+.../items+` query with `+sortby+` using descending order (`-`).
. Issue an HTTP GET request on the path.
. Parse the response to capture the sortable property for each record returned.
. Verify that reverse sorting the list of sortable properties in descending order is consistent with the response of the server.
^|Test Method |. Construct a path for a collection page.
. Check that the specific set of keys that may be used for sorting are specified by the `/collections/{collectionId}/sortables` resource
