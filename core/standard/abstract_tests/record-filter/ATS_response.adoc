^|Test Purpose |Validate filter response.
^|Requirement |<<req_record-filter_response,/req/record-filter/response>>
^|Test Method |. Construct a path for a collection items page ``/collections/{collectionId}/items``
. Construct a filter expresion with one or more of <<core-query-parameters-bbox,bbox>>, <<core-query-parameters-datetime,datetime>>, <<core-query-parameters-q,q>>, <<core-query-parameters-type,type>>, <<core-query-parameters-externalid,externalId>> and any <<additional-query-parameters,additional query parameters>>
. Issue an HTTP GET request on the path using the filter expression.
. Check that the filter expression is evaluated for each record of the collection.
. Check that all filtering parameters specified are evaluated for each record of the collection.
. If the filter expresion includes the expression ``AND`` and all the filtering expressions evaluate to ``TRUE`` then check that the record is included in the result set.
