^|A |If any additional property (see <<per_core_additional-properties,additional record properties>>) is expected to be useful for applications using at a searchable catalog endpoint, a parameter with the name of that property SHOULD be supported.
^|B |If the parameter has a simple value (e.g. a string or integer) then it SHOULD have the following characteristics (using an OpenAPI Specification 3.0 fragment):

[source,YAML]
----
name: <name of property>
in: query
required: false
style: form
explode: false
----

^|C |If the parameter is an array of simple values then it SHOULD have the following characteristics (using an OpenAPI Specification 3.0 fragment):

[source,YAML]
----
name: <name of property>
in: query
required: false
schema:
  type: array
explode: false
----

^|D |The `schema` property SHOULD be the same as the definition of the property from which the parameter is derived (see <<per_core_additional-properties,additional record properties>>).
