^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/record-collection/contact*
^|Test Purpose |Validate the behavior of `contacts` objects.
^|Requirement |<<req_record-collection_contact,/req/record-collection/contact>>
^|Test Method |. Construct a path for a catalog object.
. Issue a HTTP GET request on that path.
. Parse a `contacts` member if it exists.
. If there is a contacts `logo` member, check that the link has a `rel` property with value of `icon`. Check that the media type is an `image` media type. 
. If there is a contacts `links` member, check that the link has a `rel` property with value of `about`. Check that the media type indicates the content type of the link (e.g. `text/html` for a company's web page versus `text/vcard` for a virtual contact file).
