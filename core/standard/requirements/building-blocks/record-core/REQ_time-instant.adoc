^|*Requirement {counter:req-num}* |*/req/record-core/time-instant*
^|A |If the `time` object in a record includes a `date` member, the value SHALL conform to <<rfc3339,RFC 3339 (Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps)>> and match the production rule `full-date`.
^|B |If the `time` object in a record includes a `timestamp` member, the value SHALL conform to <<rfc3339,RFC 3339 (Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps)>> and match the production rule `date-time`.

NOTE: `date` and `timestamp` are different datatypes and so comparing them will require a cast.  This Standard does not prescribe how types are cast. The evaluation of comparison expressions that involve `date` and `timestamp` values will, therefore, be system dependent.
