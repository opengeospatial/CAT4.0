  The optional q parameter supports keyword searching.  Only records
  whose text fields contain one or more of the specified search terms
  are selected.  The specific set of text keys/fields/properties of a
  record to which the q operator is applied is up to the description
  of the server.   Implementations should, however, apply the q
  operator to the title, description and keywords keys/fields/properties.
