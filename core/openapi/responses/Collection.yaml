  Information about the record collection with id `collectionId`.

  The response contains a link to the items in the collection
  (path `/collections/{collectionId}/items`, link relation `items`)
  as well as key information about the collection. This information
  includes:

  * A local identifier for the collection that is unique for the +
    catalogue;
  * A list of coordinate reference systems (CRS) in which geometries +
    may be returned by the server. The first CRS is the default +
    coordinate reference system (the default is always WGS 84 with +
    axis order longitude/latitude);
  * An optional title and description for the collection;
  * An optional extent that can be used to provide an indication of +
    the spatial and temporal extent of the collection - typically +
    derived from the data;
  * An optional indicator about the type of the items in the collection +
    (the default value, if the indicator is not provided, is 'record').
