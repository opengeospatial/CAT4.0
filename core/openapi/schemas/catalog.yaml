          If records are encoded in-line within the catalog object,

          contains the catalog records.  By default the name of the
          records array is "records".  However, the name of this 
          array member may be different.  A local resources catalog
          is an example of a circumstance where the records array
          member may be named something other than "records".  For
          example, in the case of a local resource catalog at the 
          /collections endpoint, the name of the records array is
          "collections".
