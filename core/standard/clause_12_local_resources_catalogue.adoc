== Requirements Class "Local Resources Catalogue"

[[local-resources-catalogue-overview]]
=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_local-resources-catalogue.adoc[]

This conformance class specifies requirements for a _local resources catalogue_.

The OGC API defines a number of resource endpoints that provide lists of
sub-resources.  These endpoints are referred to as _local resources catalogues_ in this standard because they provide metadata about resources offered locally by an OGC API deployment.

NOTE: The term _local resources endpoint_ is used to reference to the resource path of the _local resources catalogue_.  The term _local resources object_ is used to refer to an instance of the object or resource that can be retrieved from the _local resources endpoint_.

The `/collections` endpoint is an example of a _local resources endpoint_.  This endpoint provides a list of objects describing the collections of items offered by an OGC API deployment.  Each offered collection (path `/collections/{collectionId}`) is described by a _local resources object_ containing a small number of properties.  A common set of properties is defined in  https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html[OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data] and can be extended by resource-specific specifications (e.g. http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html[OGC API - Feature - Part 1: Core]).  In this respect, the `/collections` endpoint is a catalogue of records (i.e. `/collections/{collectionId}` objects) describing the collections of items offered by the OGC API deployment.

Other _local resources catalogues_ available in the OGC API resource tree include the `/processes` endpoint which provides a list of offered processes and the `/collections/{collectionId}/scenes` endpoint which provides a list of source images of a coverage.

In order to enable catalogue-like searching at these local resources endpoints, this conformance class defines requirements and recommendations that:

1. enhance the information content of each local resources object  (e.g. the `/collection/{collectionId}` object) with additional members from the list of <<core-queryables,core queryables>> defined for a catalogue <<clause-records-core,record>>,

2. define or extend the set of query parameters available at the local resources endpoint (e.g. `/collections`) to enhance it searchability.

This conformance class does not define the specific endpoints in the OGC API resource tree that should be enabled with catalogue-like query capabilities.  It only defines how those endpoints should be enhanced should the requirement for catalogue-line searching be identified by the responsible OGC standard.

=== Resource Description

=== Overview

The clause defines requirements and recommendations for the information content of a local resources object that can be retrieved from local resources endpoint.

As an example of a local resources endpoint, consider the `/collections` endpoint.  The object that can be retrieved from this endpoint is defined in https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html[OGC API - Common] and http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#_collections_[OGC API - Features].  The following table cross-walks the information content of the collection object with the <<core-queryables,core queryables>> defined for the <<clause-record-core,record>> building block:

[[record-collection-crosswalk]]
[reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Crosswalk of core queryables with collection information object properties
[cols="25,25,25,25",options="header"]
|===
|Collection property |Requirement |Core Queryable |Requirement
|id                  |M           |id             |M
|title               |O           |title          |M
|description         |O           |description    |M
|itemType            |O           |--             |--
|extent              |O           |extent         |O
|links               |M           |links          |O
|crs                 |O           |--             |--
|===

It is evident that there is significant overlap of the properties of each resource.  This standard defines the following requirements and recommendations with regard to information content of a local resources object such as the collection object that is retrievable from the `/collections` endpoint.

=== Property `title`

include::requirements/local-resources-catalogue/REQ_property-title.adoc[]

=== Property `description`

include::requirements/local-resources-catalogue/REQ_property-description.adoc[]

include::recommendations/local-resources-catalogue/PER_common-mark.adoc[]

=== Property `extent`

include::recommendations/local-resources-catalogue/REC_property-extent.adoc[]

=== Property `links`

include::recommendations/local-resources-catalogue/REC_property-links.adoc[]

=== Property `type`

include::requirements/local-resources-catalogue/REQ_property-type.adoc[]

=== Property `created`

include::requirements/local-resources-catalogue/REQ_property-created.adoc[]

=== Property `updated`

include::requirements/local-resources-catalogue/REQ_property-updated.adoc[]

NOTE: Adding, modifying, or deleting items from a collection are all examples of changes that may occur that would require an update of the collection object that can be retrieved from the `/collections` endpoint.

=== Property `keywords`

include::requirements/local-resources-catalogue/REQ_property-keywords.adoc[]

=== Additional properties

include::recommendations/local-resources-catalogue/PER_additional-properties.adoc[]

=== Example

The following JSON Schema fragment illustrates how the feature collections object (path: `/collection/{collectionId}`) can be extended to include properties required and recommended by this conformance class:
