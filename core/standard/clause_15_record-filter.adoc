== Requirements Class "Filtering using the Common Query Language (CQL)"

[[record-filter-overview]]
=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_record-filter.adoc[]

This clause defines the binding to the filter parameters defined in the https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/19-079.html#_requirements_class_filter[OGC API - Features - Part 3: Filtering and the Common Query Language (CQL), Requirements Class "Filter"] clause.

=== Records

==== Operation

As specified in the <<records-access,Records Access>> clause, records are accessed using the HTTP GET method via the `/collections/{collectionId}/items` path.  The following additional requirements bind the parameters https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/19-079.html#filter-param[filter], https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/19-079.html#filter-lang-param[filter-lang] and https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/19-079.html#filter-filter-crs[filter-crs] to the GET operation on this path.

=== Filtering on links

==== Overview

Links can be added to a catalogue record in various ways.  This clause 
describes the various linking patterns and describes how to use CQL to
filter based on links.

==== Linking in records

Links can be added to the following sections in a catalogue record:

. the <<query-response,links>> section.
. the <<query-response,properties>> section.

The schema for links added to the <<query-response,links>> section is based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288[RFC 8288] and is described in https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/19-072.html#link-relation-conventions[OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core] and http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/features/part1/1.0/openapi/schemas/link.yaml[OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core].

Links added directly to the <<query-response,properties>> section of a catalogue record can be
added using the following patterns:

. The link relation is the key for an array of links with a schema similar to that used in the <<query-response,links>> section but omitting the `rel` key.
. The link relation is the key for an array of `href` values.
. The link relation is the key for an an `href` value.

The following examples illustrate each of these linking patterns:

[#linking-pattern-1,reftext=`Adding links to the **links** section.`]

            "title" : "This records as XML.",
            "href" : "https://example.org/collections/mycat/items/rec01.xml"
         },
         {
            "rel": "next",

==== Example CQL filters on links

The following example illustrates how to filter links that may
appear in a catalogue record.

[#filter-pattern-1,reftext=`Filtering links in the **links** section.`]
.Filtering links in the **links** section
----
links[rel='license'].title LIKE 'CC%'
----

[#filter-pattern-2,reftext=`Filtering links in the **properties** section.`]
.Filtering links in the **properties** section
----
properties.related[*].href LIKE '%/rec15' AND properties.license.title LIKE 'CC%'
----

[#filter-pattern-3,reftext=`Filtering links in the **properties** section.`]
.Filtering links in the **properties** section
----
properties.related LIKE '%/rec15' AND properties.license LIKE 'https://creativecommons.org/licenses/%'
----
