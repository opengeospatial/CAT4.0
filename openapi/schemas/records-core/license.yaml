type: string
description:
  A legal document under which the resource is made available.
  If the resource is being made available under a common license
  then use an SPDX license id (https://spdx.org/licenses/).
  If the resource is being made available under multiple common
  licenses then use an SPDX license expression v2.3 string
  (https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/SPDX-license-expressions/)
  If the resource is being made available under one or more licenses
  that haven't been assigned an SPDX identifier or one or more custom
  licenses then use a string value of 'other' and include one or more
  links (rel="license") in the `link` section of the record to the
  file(s) that contains the text of the license(s).
  There is also the case of a resource that is private or unpublished
  and is thus unlicensed; in this case do not register such a resource
  in the catalog in the first place since there is no point in making
  such a resource discoverable.
