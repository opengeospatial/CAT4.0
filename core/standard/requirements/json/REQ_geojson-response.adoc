^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/json/geojson-response*
^|A |200-responses SHALL support the following media type:

* `application/geo+json` for resources that include <<clause-record-core,record>> content.

^|B |The `geometry` member SHALL store a geometry, for the purpose of discovery, of the resource being described by the <<clause-record-core,record>>; this can be the actual geometry of the resource or some other representation of the space that the resource occupies.
^|C |The `extent` member SHALL include the bounding extent of the resource being described by the <<clause-record-core,record>>; if the server chooses to use the bounding box of the resource as the `geometry` of the resource then the `geometry` and `extent` values may be the same.
