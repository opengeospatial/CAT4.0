== Terms and Definitions
This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5 of https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/19-072.html[OGC API - Common Part 1] (OGC 19-072), which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word "shall" (not "must") is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard.

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

[[catalogue-def]]
=== Catalogue; Record collection
a collection of <<record-def,records>>

=== Conformance Module; Conformance Test Module
set of related tests, all within a single conformance test class (<<ogc08-131,OGC 08-131>>)

 NOTE: When no ambiguity is possible, the word `test` may be omitted. i.e. conformance test module is the same as conformance module. Conformance modules may be nested in a hierarchical way.

=== Conformance Class; Conformance Test Class
set of conformance test modules that must be applied to receive a single certificate of conformance (<<ogc08-131,OGC 08-131>>)

 NOTE: When no ambiguity is possible, the word `test` may be omitted, so conformance test class may be called a conformance class.

=== Dataset
collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more formats (DCAT)

=== Distribution
represents an accessible form of a *dataset* (DCAT)

EXAMPLE: a downloadable file, an RSS feed or a web service that provides the data.

=== Executable Test Suite (ETS)
set of code (e.g. Java and CTL) that provides runtime tests for the assertions defined by the ATS. Test data required to do the tests are part of the ETS https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=55234[(OGC 08-134)]

[[folder-def]]
=== Folder
A structure which container references to other <<catalogue-def,catalogues>>, <<record-def,records>> and/or <<folder-def,folders>>.

[[record-def]]
=== Record
atomic unit of information of a catalogue that is used to provide information about a particular resource

=== Recommendation
expression in the content of a document conveying that among several possibilities one is recommended as particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or course of action is deprecated but not prohibited (<<ogc08-131,OGC 08-131>>) 

=== Requirement
expression in the content of a document conveying criteria to be fulfilled if compliance with the document is to be claimed and from which no deviation is permitted (<<ogc08-131,OGC 08-131>>)

=== Requirements Class
aggregate of all requirement modules that must all be satisfied to satisfy a conformance test class (<<ogc08-131,OGC 08-131>>)

=== Requirements Module
aggregate of requirements and recommendations of a specification against a single standardization target type (<<ogc08-131,OGC 08-131>>)

=== Resource
an asset of interest that may be described by metadata in a catalogue for the purpose of discovery and access (i.e. binding)

=== Standardization Target
entity to which some requirements of a standard apply (<<ogc08-131,OGC 08-131>>)

 NOTE: The standardization target is the entity which may receive a certificate of conformance for a requirements class.
