^|Test Purpose |Validate the behaviour of link relations for collection link objects.
^|Requirement |<<req_record-collection_links,/req/record-collection/links>>
^|Test Method |. Construct a path for a given collection
. Issue a HTTP GET request on the path
. Parse all link objects
. If the catalogue is a <<clause-crawlable-catalogue,crawlable catalogue>>, check that the collection contains one or more link objects with a ``rel`` property with value of ``item`` that explicitly points to each record in the collection.
. If the catalogue is a <<clause-searchable-catalogue,searchable catalogue>>, check that the collection contains one link object with a ``rel`` property with value of ``items`` that points to the search/access endpoint for the records of the collection.
